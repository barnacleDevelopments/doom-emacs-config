** Transaction format
You understand that this is the format to follow when creating transactions. The account we pull money from has the transaction amount next to it.

** Seven Bays
I go to Seven Bays to climb and sometimes have a coffee. If the transaction is over $90.00 it's likely going in the Expenses:Recreation category. Otherwise it's in the takeout category.

    Expenses:Recreation                       $93.48
    Liabilities:Credit:MasterCard
** Uber
Usually when the transaction is over 20 dollars it's likely uber eats rather than uber transportation.
